## Problem

<br>

Our client (Rathnayaka Shilpiyo) currently relies on a manual ledger system to record payments and manage products, which presents numerous challenges. This outdated method is both time-consuming and prone to errors, such as incorrect transaction entries, unrecorded payments, and discrepancies between recorded stock and actual inventory. These issues can result in dissatisfied customers and missed sales opportunities. Additionally, customers are required to visit the shop in person to purchase items, restricting the business to a local audience and preventing it from reaching potential customers who value traditional wooden crafts but live further away.

The organization also relies on printed posters for event promotion, which is both costly and ineffective. This approach fails to reach a wider audience, often resulting in low participation at events designed to celebrate and share Sri Lankaâ€™s rich cultural heritage. Furthermore, client information is typically gathered informally and communicated through word of mouth, leading to frequent information loss. When customers receive faulty products, they must visit the shop to file complaints, which is inconvenient and inefficient. This outdated system not only hampers customer service but also limits the companyâ€™s ability to respond promptly to feedback, slowing its growth and hindering innovation.


<br><br>

## Motivation

<br>

Moving to an online marketplace system presents a significant opportunity for Rathnayaka Shilpiyo to resolve its current challenges and unlock numerous benefits. By implementing an automated payment tracking system, the company can greatly enhance its efficiency. This transition will minimize errors, accelerate processing times, and instantly provide accurate financial reports. Consequently, transaction management will become more streamlined, allowing the company to handle payments more effectively. Moreover, customers will have the convenience of browsing and purchasing handmade products from anywhere in the world. This global reach will not only boost sales but also promote Sri Lankan craftsmanship to a wider audience.

An online marketplace will also simplify event management and marketing efforts. By leveraging digital marketing strategies such as social media, email campaigns, and online advertisements, Rathnayaka Shilpiyo can reach a larger audience at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. This digital shift will also enable the company to measure the success of its promotional efforts more effectively. Additionally, an online feedback system will empower customers to easily share their experiences, enabling the company to respond quickly to concerns and suggestions. This improved responsiveness will enhance customer satisfaction, foster loyalty, and build a vibrant community around the brand.

In summary, transitioning to an online system will streamline operations, elevate customer service, and open up vast opportunities for growth and innovation, positioning Rathnayaka Shilpiyo as a leader in the traditional wooden crafts market.
