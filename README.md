Admins can create, update, and delete product listings. Each product includes essential details like name, description, price, and availability. Customers have view-only access to these products, enabling them to browse detailed product information. A search function is available, allowing customers to easily find products by name. Additionally, admins can generate and download product reports to track inventory or analyze customer interest.

Additionally, an integrated feedback mechanism allows customers to rate their payment experience, contributing to continuous service improvement. With a cloud-based database for real-time updates, the system eliminates the need for manual record-keeping, ensuring accurate financial management and streamlined operations for all stakeholders.

The system also allows customers to search packages by name, ensuring ease of navigation. For business analysis, admins can generate and download comprehensive package reports summarizing offerings and customer preferences.

A search tool enables customers to locate events by name. Like other modules, admins can generate and download event reports, providing valuable insights into event popularity and participation.

### üì¶ 4. Booking and Order Management

- The Booking and Order Management system empowers customers to book travel or safari packages, register for events, and place orders for tourism-related products.

Admins can also download detailed reports on all bookings and orders, supporting operational planning and improving service efficiency.
